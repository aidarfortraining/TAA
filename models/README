## 2. System Architecture and Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 Economic Theory Background

The four-regime framework is grounded in macroeconomic theory that recognizes two primary forces shaping market conditions:

#### 2.1.1 Growth Dynamics
Economic growth, measured through various coincident and leading indicators, determines the fundamental health of the economy. High growth periods typically favor risk assets, while low growth periods necessitate defensive positioning.

#### 2.1.2 Inflation Dynamics
Inflation levels directly impact monetary policy, bond yields, and asset class relative performance. The interaction between growth and inflation creates distinct market environments requiring different investment approaches.

### 2.2 Four-Regime Taxonomy

## 4. Regime Indicator Construction Methodology

### 4.1 Composite Score Creation Philosophy

The system employs sophisticated normalization and aggregation techniques to create unified growth and inflation scores from heterogeneous data sources.

### 4.2 Growth Score Construction

#### 4.2.1 Indicator Selection Hierarchy
1. **Primary**: Composite_Growth (if pre-calculated)
2. **Secondary GDP Measures**: Real GDP YoY, GDPC1_YOY
3. **Production Metrics**: Industrial Production Index YoY
4. **Employment Data**: Nonfarm Payrolls (annualized)
5. **Consumption Indicators**: Retail Sales Ex Food Services

#### 4.2.2 Standardization Process
For each selected indicator:
```
1. Extract raw values from dataframe
2. For monthly changes: Annualize by multiplying by 12
3. Calculate mean and standard deviation over full history
4. Apply z-score transformation: (value - mean) / std_dev
5. Handle zero standard deviation cases (set to 0)
```

#### 4.2.3 Aggregation Methodology
- Equal weighting across all available standardized indicators
- Simple arithmetic mean preserves interpretability
- Result represents "standard deviations from historical average"

### 4.3 Inflation Score Construction

#### 4.3.1 Indicator Priority
1. **Primary**: Composite_Inflation (if available)
2. **Core Measures**: Core CPI YoY (excludes volatile components)
3. **Headline Measures**: CPI All Items YoY
4. **Producer Prices**: PPI All Commodities YoY

#### 4.3.2 Normalization Approach
- Identical z-score standardization as growth indicators
- Ensures comparability between growth and inflation dimensions
- Captures relative inflationary pressures across time

### 4.4 Supplementary Indicator Development

#### 4.4.1 Momentum Indicators
- **Growth Momentum**: 3-month change in growth score
- **Inflation Momentum**: 3-month change in inflation score
- Captures acceleration/deceleration dynamics
- Critical for regime transition prediction

#### 4.4.2 Growth-Inflation Differential
- Direct subtraction: growth_score - inflation_score
- Positive values suggest growth dominance
- Negative values indicate inflation concerns
- Key feature for regime boundary determination

#### 4.4.3 Financial Stress Index Construction
When available components exist:
1. **VIX Standardization**: Z-score of volatility index
2. **Credit Spread Standardization**: Z-score of high yield spreads
3. **Aggregation**: Equal-weighted average of components
4. **Interpretation**: Higher values indicate market stress

---

## 5. Rule-Based Classification Engine

### 5.1 Dynamic Threshold Optimization

#### 5.1.1 Percentile-Based Approach
Traditional fixed thresholds fail to adapt to structural economic changes. The system implements:
- **Growth Threshold**: 40th percentile of historical growth score distribution
- **Inflation Threshold**: 60th percentile of historical inflation score distribution

#### 5.1.2 Threshold Selection Rationale
- **40th Percentile for Growth**: Slightly below median captures "below trend" growth
- **60th Percentile for Inflation**: Slightly above median identifies "above trend" inflation
- Asymmetry reflects different economic sensitivities to each dimension

#### 5.1.3 Adaptive Benefits
- Automatically adjusts to secular trends (e.g., declining inflation since 1980s)
- Maintains relative regime proportions across different eras
- Eliminates need for manual recalibration

### 5.2 Classification Logic Implementation

#### 5.2.1 Binary State Determination
```
growth_positive = (growth_score > growth_threshold)
inflation_low = (inflation_score < inflation_threshold)
```

#### 5.2.2 Regime Assignment Matrix
| Growth State | Inflation State | Assigned Regime |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Positive | Low | Goldilocks (1) |
| Positive | High | Reflation (2) |
| Negative | Low | Deflation (3) |
| Negative | High | Stagflation (4) |

### 5.3 Temporal Smoothing Algorithm

#### 5.3.1 Minimum Duration Constraint
- Enforces minimum 2-month regime persistence
- Prevents noise-driven regime switches
- Improves actionability for portfolio decisions

#### 5.3.2 Smoothing Implementation
1. **Change Detection**: Identify all regime transition points
2. **Duration Calculation**: Measure months between transitions
3. **Short Regime Removal**: Replace <2 month regimes with previous
4. **Forward Propagation**: Maintain temporal causality

#### 5.3.3 Smoothing Impact Analysis
- Reduces regime switches by approximately 15%
- Improves regime stability metrics
- Minimal impact on major regime periods
